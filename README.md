# Every Processing Method with Examples

In this repository I hope to demonstrate every method in the Processing Java framework with simple examples

I am taking on this project for fun and as a way to explore Processing further and hopefully discover some things I have overlooked in my time working with it thus far

# Reference

The official Processing 3 reference can be found at: [https://processing.org/reference/](https://processing.org/reference/)

You can download Processing [here](https://processing.org/download/)

# Other Resources

Whether you have been using Processing for a while or are just getting started, I *highly* recommend checking out Daniel Shiffman's "[The Coding Train](http://thecodingtrain.com/)" on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman).

His "coding challenges" are fairly short, a ton of fun, and extremely informative. Plus, all the code is available on GitHub for you to browse, download, and play with.

# Contributing

If you have an example you would like to add to the repository, please create a pull request.
