# CreateExampleFolder.js

I use this script to quickly create Processing sketch folders for the various methods as I cover them.

You are welcome to view this code as well, but because it is NodeJS and not Processing, I have not provided an explanation here.

Usage:

```sh
node ./scripts/createExampleFolder.js
```
